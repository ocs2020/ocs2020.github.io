# The Origins of Common Sense in Humans and Machines

July 29, 2020 | 42nd Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society

--------

For all their recent successes, artificial systems do not yet perform basic commonsense reasoning at the level of even young children. By understanding the origins of common sense in humans, we hope to understand how to recapitulate it in machines. In turn, by looking at the successes and failures of machines, we can make scientific progress towards understanding the initial state and learning mechanisms of human intelligence.

This workshop serves as a forum for considering theories and approaches for understanding and building common sense, presenting experimental research that probes the foundations of common sense in people, and reporting on progress on building artificial agents with infant-like commonsense reasoning capabilities.
